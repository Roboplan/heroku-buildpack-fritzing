heroku-buildpack-fritzing
=========================

Installs fritzing into `$HOME/vendor` and creates a symlink to `$HOME/vendor/bin` with the name `Fritzing`.  
This buildpack will also add $HOME/vendor to the PATH env var.

Make sure to you create a directory named '$HOME/vender/bin' in you app!!!
